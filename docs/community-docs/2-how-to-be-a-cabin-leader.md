# Cabin Leaders

You don't just want to learn, you want to contribute, you want to help make a difference in the ecosystem, you want to solidify the knowledge you've garnered. If those are some of the things that have come across your mind, then you're at the right place.

**Welcome to the Cabin Leaders programme.**

The Cabin Leaders programme is a simple program that seeks to ensure sustainability through a community effort. Not only that, it is a programme that will effectively help participants connect with others within the community, while simultaneously develop the skills required to teach, facilitate and lead.

## Who is a Cabin Leader?
Cabin leaders are members
- Who have a burning passion within their heart to contribute to the Ergo Ecosystem through being an educator.
- Who are interested in learning/solidifying knowledge regarding eUTxO and ErgoScript through teaching and facilitation of knowledge transfer.
- Who love the idea of communities and would love to strengthen the education community within Ergo through DeCo.
- Who is interested in developing leadership and teaching skills through facilitating other members in their blockchain education journey.

## What do I need, to be a Successful Cabin Leader
Being a Cabin Leader is not rocket science, it does not require intricate skills like how a neurosurgeon would have to be train. All it requires is a desire to teach/contribute.

You may have questions and doubts about your ability to teach, and it is a fair and valid feeling. Teaching, at the very end of the day is the desire to restructure and solidify concepts that you have learned. A teacher may not start off with a great and structurized knowledge base. But one thing that I can guarantee Cabin Leaders, is that at the end of the session, your understanding of the knowledge that you came in with, would have solidified at a different level. Thus solidifying the foundations you have.

**But what if I have not took DeCo courses before?**

One of our teachers, Auggie, once said, "I've learned more studying the materials to ensure that I'm able to be a good teacher, than when I attended your class." If you're worried about not having the knowledge foundation, well, everything will be in this documentation. All you need to do is follow the guide line.


In short, what you need is:
1. Desire
2. Commitment
3. Some pixie dust and playfulness in you - cause a teacher who knows how to have fun makes the class more enjoyable :P


### Alright I'm in, but
## What do I do as a Cabin Leader

It's easier as 1, 2, 3, 4.
1. Gather a group of friends/people who are interested in learning together *(We suggest a group of maximum 8 members excluding you, of course this is just a suggestion)*
2. Set a time and occurence to meet however often your group can *(Once a week, twice a week, 5 times a week, however much you want and can handle)*
3. Go through **Trails** lessons with your new group. *(One lesson per session, 2 lessons per session. However fast you guys want to. There are teachers note in there and guides on questions and discussions. Your main job is to facilitate the lesson and discussion)*
4. Celebrate the milestone with your group! *(If you ain't party-ing and celebrating, you ain't DeCo-ing)*
