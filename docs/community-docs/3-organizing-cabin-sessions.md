# Cabin Sessions

These are equivalent to a class at school. Cabin Sessions are sessions that are organized by Cabin Leaders with their members to go through DeCo Trail Lessons. This article will include a quick guide on how a session can look like if you'd like to have a guideline.

And as said in the [Cabin Leader Article](./2-how-to-be-a-cabin-leader.md). Teaching and facilitating is a form of art, so take this as pure guidelines and not follow it to a T. 

## What should I do during a Cabin Session

1. **Show up to the session early.**

A good practise is to start on time. So come early and hang out with members and build a relationship with them. This will give more meaning to the sessions and make it feel less like work and more like a hangout session between friends.

2. **Go through Content with Members**

It is best to watch the video and understand the concepts before you organize your session. This will then allow you to explain concepts during your session without even relying on the content. However, what you can also do, is to go through the content with your members together. This is a little different to navigate, so do however you see fit. ;)

3. **Discuss about ideas and walk through exercises**

There will be exercises and discussion topics that will be included in each lessons. Go through those together with the members of your group to further reinforce the contents that you have learned

4. **Adjourned the class**

Though often goes unnoticed, finishing is as important as starting. Make sure that you let all members know that class has been adjourned and cheers to everyones success of going through it together. Have a hang out session after if you'd enjoy a good ole bonding.


### With that, you're ready for your first Cabin Session!
